Abstract
--------

Introduction to PyObjC is a quick tour of PyObjC suitable for anyone with
Python experience looking to get their feet wet with Cocoa development
using their programming language of choice.  Prior Objective-C knowledge
or Interface Builder experience is not necessary.


Prerequisites
-------------

* Mac OS X 10.2 or later
* Python 2.3.0 or later (Ships with OS X 10.3 or later)
* PyObjC 1.2 or later


Background
----------

Description from http://pyobjc.sf.net/

The PyObjC project aims to provide a bridge between the Python and Objective-C
programming languages. The bridge is intended to be fully bidirectional,
allowing the Python programmer to take full advantage of the power provided by
various Objective-C based toolkits and the Objective-C programmer transparent
access to Python based functionality.


Objective-C for PyObjC Users
----------------------------

A brief overview of Objective-C syntax and Foundation semantics and how they
relate to Python.


Overview of the Bridge
----------------------

An overview of what classes, messages/functions, reference counting,
protocols, Key-Value Coding, and Key-Value Observing are and how they work
through the bridge.


Creating Your First PyObjC Application
--------------------------------------

A walkthrough of the Currency Converter tutorial, which demonstrates
usage of Interface Builder, and the application development cycle
using py2app.


Password Viewer Tutorial
------------------------

A walkthrough of the Password Viewer tutorial, which demonstrates
usage of the Xcode template, Interface Builder, and Cocoa bindings.
Additionally, I will show how to build a py2app setup script for
this project so that it may be redistributed.


Help!
-----

Overview of the documentation in PyObjC and point out examples that
show off interesting Cocoa concepts.  Discuss how to read Apple's
documentation, and where to find help on the internet (mailing list,
wiki, IRC, etc.). 


Applications Using PyObjC
-------------------------

If time allows, I will show off some of the many cool applications
developed in PyObjC, many of which are open source.  Some examples
include ReSTedit and DrawBot.  For most of these applications, I
can answer questions about how they are implemented.
